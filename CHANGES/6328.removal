The fileystem exporter endpoint has been moved from ``/exporters/file/file/`` to
``/exporters/file/filesystem/`` and the export endpoint is now at POST
``/exporters/file/filesystem/<uuid>/exports/``. Additionally, the table is being dropped and
recreated due to a data structure change in core so users will lose any filesystem exporter data on
upgrade.
